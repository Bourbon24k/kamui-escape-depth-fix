# KAMUI — iOS 27.x sandbox escape + MobileGestalt editor

> *Kamui (神威) — the eye that phases matter into another dimension. Here one
> symlinked part directory makes `containermanagerd` issue a sandbox extension
> for a container that should be out of reach.*

**Open source, MIT licensed and free for everyone.** KAMUI is not limited to
testers, a private group or an allowlist. Anyone can use, study, modify,
redistribute and ship the MobileGestalt editor under the MIT license.

Supported: **iOS 27.0.1 – 27.2** (primary target 27.2 / 24B115).

This repository contains the escape engine, the **KAMUI** app source (internal
target `BQTool`) and the release IPA.

---

## 0. Who can use it

**Everyone.** There is no invitation, tester list, waitlist or account. Clone
the repository, build the app, install the IPA, fork it, publish your own
build — the MIT license allows all of it.

The MobileGestalt editor itself has no access check and no allowlist. The only
technical requirement on **iOS 27.2** is that the running app has at least
one `com.apple.security.application-groups` entitlement, because the class-7
escape path uses the app-group container. KAMUI reads that entitlement at
runtime. On some **27.0.x** builds the legacy class-13 traversal may work even
without an app group.

---

## 1. What this is

KAMUI is a **container-level sandbox escape**: a normally sandboxed app
obtains a read/write sandbox extension for an MCM container outside its own
sandbox. It is not root and not a kernel exploit; arbitrary paths outside MCM
remain protected. It is enough to:

- read and write the live **MobileGestalt** cache
  (`systemgroup.com.apple.mobilegestaltcache/Library/Caches/com.apple.MobileGestalt.plist`);
- install custom **PosterBoard** wallpapers (`.tendies` descriptors) into the
  Collections, Mercury and Photos providers;
- read and write **every MCM container**: app data, app groups, system groups,
  system data, internal daemons and plugins.

The included app is a full UIKit toolbox:

- **Gestalt** — presets (Dynamic Island, AOD, Boot Chime, Charge Limit, Tap to
  Wake, Stage Manager, Apple Pencil, Action Button, Collision SOS, Parallax
  off), device-subtype picker, full `CacheExtra` editor (add/edit/delete;
  String/Integer/Boolean/Data), apply/revert/respring, backup.
- **PosterBoard** — import `.tendies`, apply all, online wallpaper catalog
  (`SerStars/Nugget-Wallpapers`), reset, open PosterBoard, respring.
- **Files** — full MCM container browser: app data, app groups, system groups,
  system data, internal daemons and plugins; browse, read, edit text, import
  and delete files through the class-7 escape.
- **Settings** — diagnostics, in-place/atomic write toggle, log viewer.

## 2. The bug

### 2.1 Old `bad_query` is patched on 27.2

`bad_query` used `container_query_operation_set_part_domain` with `..`
traversal:

```objc
query_set_class(q, 13);
query_set_group_identifiers(q, xpc_string_create("systemgroup.com.apple.mobilegestaltcache"));
query_set_part(q, 3);                 // Library/Caches
query_set_part_domain(q, "../../../../../../../.." + path);
query_set_flags(q, 0x8100000000);
```

On 27.2:

- `MCMXPCMessageQuery` rejects a `SystemDataDomain` containing `..`
  (`Rejecting query with invalid partDomain`).
- `MCMFileManager realPathForURL:ifChildOfURL:` resolves symlinks and rejects
  absolute/outside targets when `partDomain` is non-empty.
- A direct class-13 query returns the MG path but **no sandbox token** for an
  app without the matching entitlement.

### 2.2 The part-directory symlink

The fix validates `partDomain`, but **not the part directory itself** when the
domain is empty:

1. The app-group container is writable. Replace
   `<app group>/Library/Caches` with a symlink to the target container.
2. Query MCM:
   - class **7** (app group),
   - own group identifier,
   - part **3** (`Library/Caches`),
   - **empty** `partDomain`,
   - flags `0x8100000000` (include path + extension type 3).
3. `containermanagerd` builds `<app group>/Library/Caches`, sees a symlink, and
   issues the sandbox extension for the **resolved target**.
4. `sandbox_extension_consume` grants read/write to the target.

No traversal string is involved, so the 27.2 checks never see `..` and never
get a non-empty `partDomain` to validate.

The symlink is removed and the original `Library/Caches` restored after each
operation. Crashes are recovered on the next run (`Caches.bqtool` backup).

### 2.3 Why not the app's own container (class 2)?

On iOS 27.2 the sandbox denies `rename()` of every class-2 part directory from
inside the app:

```
Library/Preferences  -> EPERM (errno 1)
Library/Caches       -> EPERM (errno 1)
Documents            -> EPERM (errno 1)
tmp                  -> EPERM (errno 1)
SystemData           -> EPERM (errno 1)
```

Only the app-group part directory is writable/renameable, so an app group is
required for the primary strategy. This is a sandbox policy limit.

### 2.4 Dynamic app group

Old builds hardcoded one group. KAMUI reads the app's own runtime entitlements:

```objc
SecTaskRef task = SecTaskCreateFromSelf(kCFAllocatorDefault);
CFTypeRef groups = SecTaskCopyValueForEntitlement(
    task, CFSTR("com.apple.security.application-groups"), NULL);
```

It picks the first group that yields a
`containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier` container. The MCM query
uses that group identifier. A build with **any** app group works; there is no
hardcoded identifier.

### 2.5 Multi-strategy escape (27.0.1–27.2)

`BQEscape` tries, in order, and logs every attempt:

| # | Strategy | Needs app group | Likely versions |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | class 13 + `partDomain` traversal (old `bad_query`) | no | 27.0.x where traversal is still open |
| 2 | class 7 part-directory symlink | yes | 27.2 |
| 3 | class 13 direct MG query | no | builds that issue a token |
| 4 | class 12 geod + traversal | no | older builds |

The first successful strategy is used. A result but no token is logged as
`token=NO consume=-5` (`-5` is the app's "no token / consume failed", not an
installation error).

---

## 3. Reachable targets

Confirmed on 27.2 (redacted):

- **MobileGestalt** — 10 740-byte binary plist, parsed as `__NSDictionaryI`,
  79→80 `CacheExtra` keys, opened `O_RDWR`, marker written.
- **PosterBoard** — app data container
  `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>`; all three descriptor
  folders writable:
  - `com.apple.WallpaperKit.CollectionsPoster/descriptors`
  - `com.apple.MercuryPoster/descriptors`
  - `com.apple.PhotosUIPrivate.PhotosPosterProvider/descriptors`
- **App data containers** — 245 containers enumerated with `fsgetpath` and
  opened with tokens; the Files tab reaches 245 app data containers, 114 app
  groups, 27 system groups, 22 system data containers, 21 internal daemons and
  877 plugins on 27.2.
- **PosterBoard `.tendies` pipeline** — 25-file ZIP extracted, descriptor
  found, IDs randomized, folder written to the WallpaperKit provider.

The same technique can reach other MCM containers whose path is known.

---

## 4. Build

Requirements: Linux/macOS, clang, Python 3, an iOS SDK (Theos SDK works), zlib.

```bash
./build.sh
# -> build/KAMUI-2.4.11.ipa
```

The default bundle identifier is `com.kamui.escape`. Override with `BID=...`.
The SDK path can be overridden with `SDK=...`.

---

## 5. Install and runtime requirement

Anyone can install `KAMUI-2.4.11.ipa`; use whatever installation method you
normally use.

The primary 27.2 strategy needs the running app to have at least one
`com.apple.security.application-groups` entitlement. KAMUI reads its own
entitlements at runtime and uses the first group that has a container URL.

- **With an app group** — class 7 is attempted after the class-13 fallback and
  is the working path on 27.2.
- **Without an app group** — the app logs `(none)` and tries the legacy
  class-13 traversal. That may work on some 27.0.x builds; it is closed on
  27.2.

There is no hardcoded group identifier, so any build that grants an app group
can use the primary path.

---

## 6. Usage

On first launch:

- Gestalt loads the live MG plist and creates
  `Documents/OriginalGestalt.plist` (true original) if missing.
- Apply writes the plist (in-place with rollback, or atomic), verifies it and
  offers a respring.
- Revert restores the backup.
- PosterBoard → Import `.tendies` / Explore Wallpapers → Apply → Open
  PosterBoard / Respring.

**Keep `OriginalGestalt.plist`.** If the app is deleted, the backup goes with
it.

---

## 7. Logs and diagnostics

- `Documents/bqtool.log` — session log (iOS build, group identifier, every
  strategy, MG reads/writes, ZIP/descriptor apply).
- Settings → Run Diagnostics — MG read/write check + PosterBoard container
  search.
- Settings → Open Log — viewer with refresh/clear.

If an escape fails, the first lines show which strategy failed and why:

```
strategy class13-traversal: ... result=0x0 token=NO consume=-5
strategy class7-symlink: ... result=0x... token=YES consume=3
escape: using class7 symlink
```

---

## 8. Version notes

- **2.5.0** — adds the Files tab / full MCM container browser and fixes the
  post-load Gestalt key-sorting crash. Arbitrary paths outside MCM remain
  blocked.
- **27.2 (24B115)** — primary, tested: class-13 traversal closed; class-7
  part-directory symlink works.
- **27.0.1 / 27.1** — the class-13 traversal or class-12 geod fallback may
  still work, possibly without an app group. If all strategies return `-5`,
  send `Documents/bqtool.log`; the log distinguishes an entitlement problem
  from a build-specific MCM change.
- The app is built with the iOS 14.5 SDK and runs on 27.x.

### Diagnostic notes

For each device/build send the first 15–20 lines of `Documents/bqtool.log`:

```
=== BQEscape start | iOS <build> | bundle ...
app group entitlement: <group or (none)>
strategy class13-traversal: result=... token=... consume=...
strategy class7-symlink: result=... token=... consume=...
escape: using ...
```

This distinguishes:

- no app group + traversal closed → entitlement/installation limitation;
- app group present + class 7 neither result nor token → version-specific MCM
  change;
- result but no token → entitlement or target-path issue;
- token but consume fails → kernel/extension mismatch.

---

## 9. Limitations and safety

- No root, no kernel, no arbitrary `/var` access. Only MCM containers (or
  paths reachable through the legacy traversal on vulnerable builds).
- POSIX DAC still applies; write only where user `mobile` can write.
- MobileGestalt edits can break features or soft-brick the device. Keep the
  backup. Do not apply unknown keys. Risky keys (iPadOS mode, internal install)
  are not part of the presets for a reason.
- PosterBoard Reset removes **all** descriptors from the supported provider
  folders, including stock collections; PosterBoard normally regenerates stock
  ones.
- Use it only on devices you own or have permission to modify.

---

## 10. Disclosure and public use

KAMUI is public, MIT-licensed research. The primitive and the MobileGestalt
editor are available to everyone; there is no embargo, tester list or private
group.

- If you find a bug in KAMUI, open a GitHub issue or security advisory.
- If you want to report the underlying MCM behavior to Apple, use **Apple
  Security Bounty** (Sandbox Escape category) and include the iOS build, the
  exact query (class 7 / part 3 / empty `partDomain` / flags `0x8100000000`),
  the symlinked part-directory behavior, and a video/log of MobileGestalt
  write + PosterBoard descriptor write.
- Suggested fix direction: canonicalize and validate the **part directory**
  against the container for every part, and reject symlinked part directories
  regardless of `partDomain`. The current checks cover `partDomain` but not the
  part path itself.
